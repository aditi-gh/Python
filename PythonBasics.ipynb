What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","   - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.\n","\n","    Its popularity stems from several factors:\n","\n","    - Readability: Python's clear syntax makes it easy to learn and read, resembling natural language.\n","    - Versatility: It can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.\n","    - Large Standard Library: Python comes with a comprehensive collection of modules and packages, providing pre-written code for various tasks.\n","    - Vibrant Community: A large and active community contributes to Python's growth through libraries, frameworks, and support forums.\n","    - Extensive Libraries and Frameworks: Beyond the standard library, a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries (like NumPy, pandas, Django, Flask, TensorFlow, PyTorch) extends Python's capabilities for specific domains.\n","\n","2. What is an interpreter in Python\n","  - An interpreter is a program that directly executes instructions written in a programming language, without requiring them to be compiled into machine code beforehand. In Python, the interpreter reads and executes code line by line.\n","\n","3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","  - Pre-defined keywords (also known as reserved words) in Python are special words that have specific meanings and purposes in the language. They are part of the Python syntax and cannot be used as identifiers (like variable names, function names, etc.).\n","  Some examples of Python keywords include:\n","\n","    - if, else, elif (for conditional statements)\n","    - for, while (for loops)\n","    - def (to define functions)\n","    - class (to define classes)\n","    - import, from (to import modules)\n","    - True, False, None (special constant values)\n","    - and, or, not (logical operators)\n","    - try, except, finally (for exception handling)\n","\n","4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","  - No, pre-defined keywords in Python cannot be used as variable names or any other identifiers. They have reserved meanings in the language syntax. Attempting to use a keyword as a variable name will result in a SyntaxError.\n","\n","5. What is mutability in Python?\n","  - In Python, mutability means whether an object's value can change after creation. Mutable objects (like lists, dicts, sets) can be modified in place, while immutable objects (like ints, strings, tuples) cannot be changed—any modification creates a new object.\n","\n","6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","  - Lists are mutable because they are designed to store collections of items that can change in size or content. You can add, remove, or update elements inside a list without creating a new object, which makes them flexible for dynamic data handling. Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable because they are meant to represent fixed collections of items. Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed. This immutability makes tuples faster, memory-efficient, and safer to use as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets (since only immutable objects can be hashed).\n","\n","7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","  - Difference between == and is in Python\n","\n","    - == (Equality operator): Compares the values of two objects (i.e., whether the contents are the same).\n","\n","    - is (Identity operator): Compares the memory location of two objects (i.e., whether they are the exact same object in memory).\n","\n","8. What are logical operators in Python?\n","  - In Python, logical operators are used to make decisions by combining or modifying conditions, and they always return a Boolean value (True or False). There are three main logical operators:\n","\n","    - and → Returns True if both conditions are true, otherwise False.\n","\n","    - or → Returns True if at least one condition is true, otherwise False.\n","\n","    - not → Reverses the result; it returns True if the condition is false, and False if the condition is true.\n","\n","9.  What is type casting in Python?\n","  -  In Python, type casting (or type conversion) is the process of changing a value from one data type to another. It allows to us convert between types like integers, floats, strings, etc.\n","\n","10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","  - Implicit Type Casting (Type Conversion): Done automatically by Python. Happens when a smaller data type is converted into a larger data type to avoid data loss.\n","  - Explicit Type Casting (Type Casting by User): Done manually using functions like int(), float(), str(), list(), etc.\n","\n","11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","  - The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to control the flow of a program by making decisions based on conditions. They allow the program to execute certain blocks of code only when specific conditions are true.\n","  For example, using if, elif, and else, Python can check conditions and decide which code to run.\n","\n","12. How does the elif statement work?\n","  - The elif statement in Python is short for “else if”. It is used when you want to check multiple conditions one after another.\n","    - The program evaluates conditions from top to bottom.\n","    - As soon as one condition is True, its block of code runs, and the rest are skipped.\n","    - If none of the conditions are true, the else block (if present) executes.\n","\n","13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","  - For Loop\n","    - Used when you know exactly how many times you want to repeat something.\n","    - Iterates over a sequence (like list, string, range).\n","    - Automatically ends when the sequence is exhausted.\n","\n","  - While Loop\n","    - Used when you don't know in advance how many times to loop.\n","    - Runs as long as a condition is true.\n","    - You must update variables inside to avoid infinite loops.\n","\n","14.  Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n","  - A while loop is more suitable than a for loop when you don't know beforehand how many times the loop needs to run, and the iteration depends on a condition being true.\n","    - Example Scenario: Suppose you are writing a program that keeps asking the user to enter a password until they get it right. Here, the number of attempts is unknown. The loop continues until the user enters the correct password, making a while loop the best choice.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"hDAMr2wN3KFk"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Practical Questions**"],"metadata":{"id":"RIk3ZJmypX5l"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Write a Python program to print \"Hello, World!\"\n","print(\"Hello, World!\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"bnBQ67-UpE3Z","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1755343981920,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":12,"user":{"displayName":"Aditi Priya","userId":"07210172895891510382"}},"outputId":"853a43b1-dbcc-456c-e996-3244814e4c01"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Hello, World!\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Write a Python program that displays your name and age.\n","name = input(\"Enter name: \")\n","age = input(\"Enter age: \")\n","print(f\"My name is {name} and your age is {age}.\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"9HPMf_ddp4sh","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1755344222221,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5875,"user":{"displayName":"Aditi Priya","userId":"07210172895891510382"}},"outputId":"d3a840ab-9682-4fba-e32a-29436d35e29a"},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Enter name: Aditi\n","Enter age: 20\n","My name is Aditi and your age is 20.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Write code to print all the pre-defined keywords in Python using the keyword library.\n","import keyword\n","print(keyword.kwlist)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"AxF1-lJ8qx9I","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1755344416225,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":54,"user":{"displayName":"Aditi Priya","userId":"07210172895891510382"}},"outputId":"a2acbfe4-5afa-4f45-846d-50b0f1eece73"},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Write a program that checks if a given word is a Python keyword.\n","import keyword\n","\n","word = input(\"Enter a word: \")\n","\n","if word in keyword.kwlist:\n","  print(f\"'{word}' is a Python keyword.\")\n","else:\n","  print(f\"'{word}' is not a Python keyword.\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Tu5DZNZPrivb","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1755344650689,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":13960,"user":{"displayName":"Aditi Priya","userId":"07210172895891510382"}},"outputId":"8e0167f3-68a5-462d-929d-fc62997a6c2b"},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Enter a word: switch\n","'switch' is not a Python keyword.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Create a list and tuple in Python, and demonstrate how attempting to change an element works differently for each.\n","\n","# Create a list\n","my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n","print(\"Original list:\", my_list)\n","\n","# Attempt to change an element in the list\n","my_list[0] = 10\n","print(\"Modified list:\", my_list)\n","\n","# Create a tuple\n","my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4)\n","print(\"\\nOriginal tuple:\", my_tuple)\n","\n","# Attempt to change an element in the tuple (this will raise a TypeError)\n","try:\n","  my_tuple[0] = 10\n","except TypeError as e:\n","  print(\"Error when attempting to modify tuple:\", e)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"2mKhTr9csYlg","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1755344723188,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":50,"user":{"displayName":"Aditi Priya","userId":"07210172895891510382"}},"outputId":"241a4a55-bd4a-4611-dd17-318206b11f6d"},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n","Modified list: [10, 2, 3, 4]\n","\n","Original tuple: (1, 2, 3, 4)\n","Error when attempting to modify tuple: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Write a function to demonstrate the behavior of mutable and immutable arguments.\n","\n","def demonstrate_mutability(mutable_list, immutable_int):\n","\n","  print(f\"Inside function (before change):\")\n","  print(f\"  mutable_list: {mutable_list}\")\n","  print(f\"  immutable_int: {immutable_int}\")\n","\n","  #
